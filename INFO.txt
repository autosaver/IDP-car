We have made a rc car with many combined features like line following , obstacle avoiding and a wireless surveillance camera on top for surveillance.This car is controlled by a bluetooth module connected to android phone for wireless control.The program for the car is run by arduino uno board in which the program is made to shift from one mode to other on certain command. As this car can be used for wireless camera used for the purpose of observing an area. They are often connected to a recording device or IP network, and may be watched by a security guard or law enforcement officer. Its line following ability can be used in industries as automated equipment carriers.The factories can make a robot and get most of the work done by it. There is no need for a human operator, the robot can perform the repetitive tasks that follow the same path on its own.And finally the obstacle avoidance feature is used for detecting obstacles and avoiding the collision
